	<p>2022 was the beginning of my progamming journey. I had completed a civil engineering major few years ago and even though my working experience was mostly fine, I felt the need for next goals and to break out of the routine of everyday life. I&rsquo;ve had an interest for technology and computers since I was a kid, so I started learning programming on my own and quickly realized that it is something I would potentially like to do for a living. This blog is the next step on my journey to give some insight to my thoughts surrounding progamming and to present some of my works I have completed.</p>
