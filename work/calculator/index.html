	<p>Last year ended with me completing Harvard&rsquo;s CS50 and I started looking for next courses to build up on that foundation. After a while I stumbled upon Princeton Algorithms, which is a terrific but also extremely challenging for a beginner, especially if you haven&rsquo;t programmed in Java before. After a couple homeworks completed, I really started to click with Java and I also started to solve Leetcode problems using Java (I had mainly used Python previously). After a while I also stumbled across a github document, which listed different projects to do from scratch - twitter, netflix, facebook and so on. Obviously these were way beyond my scope, but it inspired me to try and complete my first project which is a <a href="https://github.com/kjuurma/Calculator">calculator</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some main things I learned during this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Java Swing - a toolkit, part of Java Foundation Classes, which provides you a set of elements to create a GUI. Thanks to an indian teenager I was able to construct a simple GUI rather quickly.</li>
<li>Java ActionListener Inferace and Lambda Expressions - somehow I hadn&rsquo;t previously used ActionListener interface before. CS50 was an extremely comprehensive course, but skipped pretty much the majority of JavaScript possibilities and therefore many elements related to a webpage or a program being dynamic. Thanks to IntelliJ constantly critizising my code, I learned about Lambda functions as well to make my code look cleaner.</li>
<li>Problems related to the size of different data types. I first tried to set up my calculator using double datatype, but during testing I was reminded of the limits of primitive datatypes. For example, a simple operation like 0,04 - 0,03 would give me a long approximation 0,00999999998 instead of 0,01. After some searching I settled for BigDecimal class, which provides correct answers for my simple calculations.</li>
</ol>
<p>This calculator project was definitely educational and though it was simple, I had to rewrite some parts of my code as I progressed to next steps. In the future, I could definitely improve the program by adding new fuctions like trigonometry and logarithms, the user interface readability could be improved and I should definitely try to modify the program in a way so one could enter numbers and operations on keyboard.</p>
