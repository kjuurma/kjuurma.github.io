      <description>Last year ended with me completing Harvard&amp;rsquo;s CS50 and I started looking for next courses to build up on that foundation. After a while I stumbled upon Princeton Algorithms, which is a terrific but also extremely challenging for a beginner, especially if you haven&amp;rsquo;t programmed in Java before.

      <description>Today is the day I finally make my first post on my own page. Technically, it is not 100% mine, because I used Hugo and custom theme for setup. The reason I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo is that it requires a bit more effort on the technical side, which is a bonus on my journey to learn programming.
Even though there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of materials on the internet to setup a simple blog on Hugo, It still took me several evenings to figure out the final layout settings.</description>
